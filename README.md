# 🛡️ Man-in-the-Middle Attack using DNS Spoofing and Credential Harvesting

This project demonstrates a **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack** using **DNS spoofing** to redirect a victim to a fake login page, where their credentials are captured by the attacker. The attack was executed in a safe, controlled virtual environment using Kali Linux, Bettercap, a custom Python HTTP server, and Wireshark.

## 📌 Project Summary

- ✅ Spoofed domain: `veryrealloginpage.com`  
- ✅ Bettercap used for ARP poisoning + DNS spoofing  
- ✅ Fake login page hosted via custom `server.py`  
- ✅ Credentials captured in attacker terminal  
- ✅ Wireshark used to confirm POST data in transit

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

| Tool               | Purpose                                 |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Kali Linux         | Attacker VM (Bettercap, server, capture) |
| Ubuntu             | Victim system                            |
| Bettercap          | DNS spoofing + ARP poisoning             |
| Python HTTP Server | Hosts fake login and logs credentials    |
| Wireshark          | Network traffic analysis                 |
| UTM (macOS)        | Virtual machine manager                  |

## 🧪 How the Attack Works

1. **Bettercap** poisons the network and spoofs DNS for `veryrealloginpage.com`.  
2. **Victim** visits the spoofed domain and sees a fake login page.  
3. **Python server** receives credentials and logs them.
4. **Wireshark** captures the HTTP POST request and reveals credentials in plain text.

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

- Understood MITM attacks via DNS spoofing  
- Hands-on experience with Bettercap and Wireshark  
- Learned to build and debug a fake credential-capturing HTTP server  
- Realized the importance of HTTPS and DNSSEC
